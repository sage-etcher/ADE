North Star DOS and N* CP/M have different options for varying the number of 
drives and drive types


NS GDOS (Installed Drives, Stepping Speed)
=====

                   Drive Number        Fast/Normal Stepping

   |    Bit No. 7         1        |           0=Normal      Bit No. 0     ^
   |    Bit No. 6         2        |           1=Fast        Bit No. 1     |
   |    Bit No. 5         3        |           1             Bit No. 2     |
   V    Bit No. 4         4        |           1             Bit No. 3     |

So if you have drives 1 and 2, and drive 2 is a fast stepping drive,
bits 7,6 and 1 are set ( = C2 (hex) )

Notice that Drive Number bits begin with MSB, stepping speed bits begin
with the LSB


This hardware information byte resides at F834 hex in GDOS.

This is byte at 0834 of the GHDOS disk-image file




CP/M (Number of Floppy Drives)
=====

The valid range is 0-1, 0 = one drive, 1 = two drives.
The drive byte is situated at Disk Sector 7, offset 01E8(hex). This is byte
number 0FE8 in the CP/M disk-image file.

In the standard Advantage 64K CP/M vers. 1.2.0, this byte is located in RAM at E6E8.
