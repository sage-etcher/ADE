NOTES 1:

Data and Application floppies above are not necessarily BOOTABLE DISKS.
All System Floppies are bootable. Those marked with + are North Star DOS.
Backup/Recovery disks need to be restored using the HDSUPPLEMENT disk.

NOTES 2:

Not all North Star Advantage floppy disk imagefiles mentioned here and that
are available are supplied with this ADE software package.  Other North Star
Advantage software on floppy disk imagefiles are downloadable from the
website www.itelsoft.com.au


NOTES 3:

  CPMBASIC_120A1.NSI - a copy of CPMBASIC_120.NSI which has been patched to
                     look at Drive A: for any .COM files. This removes
                     the need for copies of .COM files to be installed on 
                     every drive.
